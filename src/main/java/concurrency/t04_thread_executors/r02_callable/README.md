# Executing Tasks in an Executor that Returns a Result

`Callable` is an interface that has a `call()` method. The `call()` method 
returns a result. `Callable` is a parameterized interface and the type of 
the return value of the `call()` is expected.

`Future` is another interface that has some methods to obtain the result 
generated by a `Callable` object, and to manage its state.

To execute the task defined in a `Callable`, send it to an `ExecutorService` 
by calling the `submit()` method. The `submit()` takes in a `Callable` 
object and returns a `Future` object. 

We can use the `Future` object to check if the task is completed by calling 
the `isDone()` method, or cancel the task by calling its `cancel()` method. 
We can also retrieve the result by calling the `get()` method. This method 
will block the current thread until the task defined in the `Callable` has 
finished. If the `call()` on the `Callable` throws an exception, the `get()` 
method will throw an `ExecutionException`.
