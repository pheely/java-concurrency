# ThreadGroup

- Java's `ThreadGroup` allows us to treat the threads of a group as a single unit and provide access to the thread elements.
- A `ThreadGroup` object can be formed by thread objects and another `ThreadGroup` object.
- We can also write a generic method ot process all uncaught exceptions thrown by a thread or a group of threads.
